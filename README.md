## Podcast Scraping

I wanted to gain some insights about the current podcast market and could not find anything useful in terms of quantitative data. So I decided to build a usable data set myself by scraping the Apple iTunes page, store them in a cloud data base (MongoDB Atlas) and use the results later to find the RSS feeds using the iTunes API. Currently the webscraping is running and will probably take a couple of days to complete.

### Update 29.06.2020
The scraping of podcast information from the iTunes homepage is nearly done. In the meantime I started retrieving the rss feed urls through the iTunes API
